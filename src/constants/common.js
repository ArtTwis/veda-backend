To accomplish this goal, browsers which support the secure attribute will only send cookies with the secure attribute when the request is going to an HTTPS page. Said in another way, the browser will not send a cookie with the secure attribute set over an unencrypted HTTP request. By setting the secure attribute, the browser will prevent the transmission of a cookie over an unencrypted channel.
